* constant folding  - OK
  lit x
  lit y
  op      \ where op is + - / *
  -> lit (x y op)

* :noname to work in compiled mode
  - compiles to constant pool and emits lit <executiontoken>
  - in immediate mode, should work like before

* refactor duplicated code that checks for bytecodes that have args
  - to single function

* debugger  - OK, rudimentary implementation done
  - breakpoint word
  - drops into a debug interpreter, exit with a word that resumes execution
  - disassemble next instructions to be executed etc

* unsigned comparisons
