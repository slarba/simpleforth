* unit test framework!!   OK

* a complete set of unit tests to test the interpreter features!

* string concatenation

* string formatting

* file-io (read and write operations)

* constant folding  - SEMI-OK, more runs to chain longer constant exprs, logical exprs
  lit x
  lit y
  op      \ where op is + - / *
  -> lit (x y op)

* peephole patterns
  - logical operations (double invert etc, or's with zeros)

* :noname to work in compiled mode  - OK, :lambda ;; implemented
  - compiles to constant pool and emits lit <executiontoken>
  - in immediate mode, should work like before

* temporary stack  - OK, implemented >t, t>, tsp! and tsp@

* refactor duplicated code that checks for bytecodes that have args
  - to single function

* debugger  - OK, rudimentary but useful implementation done
  - breakpoint word
  - drops into a debug interpreter, exit with a word that resumes execution
  - disassemble next instructions to be executed etc

* unsigned comparisons
  - print-stack-trace crashes on 32bit systems due to this

* in-place resizable "here area"   - NOK, trouble with mremap

* floating point support
  - stack, operations

* oop system to use temp stack for self pointers

* locals implementation

* autocompletion using realine to search vocabulary

* general refactoring of code
